Western Blot
Materials:
None
Steps:
1. Groups of 10 female third instar wandering larvae were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and were homogenised in 2× lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; 2 mM EDTA; 1% SDS; 2% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 11873580001).
2. Homogenates were spun down at 13,000 RPM for 30 seconds, and supernatant was collected
3. Laemmli buffer was added to supernatant and the resulting solution was boiled at 96° C for 7 minutes
4. Samples were run on SDS/PAGE gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose using semi-dry blotting
5. Blots were labelled with monoclonal antibodies to the ?-subunit of ATP synthase (Abcam AB14730) diluted 1/1500, actin (Abcam AB8224) diluted 1/25,000, the NDUFS3 subunit of Complex I (Abcam AB14711) diluted 1/800
